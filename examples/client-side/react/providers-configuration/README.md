# Providers Configuration

## onlyWagmi

If you are using wagmi, you can use the `onlyWagmi` prop to set the wagmi provider as exclusive. This means that the wagmi provider will be the only provider that will be shown in the modal.

You can find an example of the code in the `with-wagmi.jsx` file.

## defaultProvider

If you are not using wagmi, or you want more granular control over how the default provider is displayed, you can use the `defaultProvider` prop to set the default provider.

You can find a examples in the `with-default-provider.jsx` and `with-privy-default-provider.jsx` files.
